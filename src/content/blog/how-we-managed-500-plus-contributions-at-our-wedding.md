We had 500+ contributions at our wedding — cash at the entrance, UPI all day, and multiple events. The number wasn’t the problem. The problem was keeping a clear record: who gave what, so we could thank people properly and not end up with a pile of unmarked envelopes and a bank statement that didn’t match any list.

Here’s what worked for us.

## One place, not three

At 500+, you can’t have some names in a notebook, some in a spreadsheet, and some only in UPI screenshots. We needed one list that everyone trusted. Pick one system — a shared spreadsheet or a dedicated contribution link — and make sure every person who’s logging knows that’s the only place. If you split it, you’ll spend weeks reconciling.

## More than one person logging

One person at one desk can’t handle hundreds of entries across multiple entry points and events. You need two or three people who can add contributions in real time. That means your system has to support multiple people editing at once and show the same list to everyone. Otherwise you get duplicate entries, or someone’s stack of envelopes never gets entered.

## Log as it happens

Don’t wait until the end of the day or the end of the event. The moment someone hands over an envelope, write the name on it and get it into the list. When a UPI comes in, log it with the name (from the note or from the person) right away. At 500+, “we’ll do it later” means you’ll never catch up and you’ll forget who gave what.

## Mark cash envelopes immediately

Unmarked cash is the fastest way to lose track. As soon as someone hands you an envelope, ask for the name if you don’t know it, and write it on the envelope before you put it anywhere. That way even if logging is delayed, the envelope itself is the record.

## Export and back up when you’re done

When the function is over, export the list — CSV or a clean download — and store it somewhere safe. That’s your long-term record for thank-yous and for when their turn comes. If your system is only online and you never export, you’re one login or link expiry away from losing the list.

## The tool we used

We built [Moi](https://getmoi.in) for exactly this. One event, one link (or QR). Multiple people can log at the same time and see the same list. Guests pay via UPI through the link so the contribution is recorded with their name — no chasing screenshots. When you’re done, you export the list. No app for guests, no passwords.

If you’re facing a few hundred contributions and don’t want to rely on a single notebook or a messy spreadsheet, you can [set up an event in under a minute](https://app.getmoi.in/signup). It’s free.

You don’t need a perfect system. You need one place, several people who can update it, and the habit of logging as things happen. That’s what kept 500+ manageable for us.
