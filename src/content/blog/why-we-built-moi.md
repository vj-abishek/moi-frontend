Every Indian wedding has that one person — usually an uncle or a cousin — sitting with a notebook, scribbling names and amounts as guests hand over envelopes. The pen runs out. The handwriting gets messy. Someone forgets to note down who gave what. By the end of the night, pages are missing and nobody can read the numbers.

We've all been there.

Moi exists because that notebook system hasn't changed in decades, even though everything else has. We wanted to build something that respects the tradition while making it actually work.

## What we got right

**No app to install.** Your 70-year-old grandmother shouldn't need to download anything. Moi works in any browser, on any device.

**No passwords.** Sign in with a magic link or Google. That's it. No password resets, no forgotten credentials.

**Real-time tracking.** Multiple family members can log contributions simultaneously. Everyone sees the same data, updated instantly.

**Simple export.** When the event is over, download everything as a CSV. Your records, your data.

## What we intentionally left out

We didn't build payment processing. We didn't add social features. We didn't create a marketplace for vendors. There are plenty of apps trying to be everything for weddings.

Moi does one thing: track who gave what. That's the job, and we're focused on doing it well.

## Built for trust

We don't sell your data. We don't send marketing emails. We don't require unnecessary permissions. Your contribution records are yours.

If you've ever struggled with that notebook at a function, give Moi a try. It's free, and it takes 30 seconds to set up your first event.
