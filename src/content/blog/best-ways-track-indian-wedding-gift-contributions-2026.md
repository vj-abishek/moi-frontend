Indian weddings run on contributions — cash in envelopes, UPI, sometimes both. The money isn’t the hard part. The hard part is knowing who gave what so you can thank people and return the gesture when their turn comes. Here are the ways people actually do it.

## 1. The physical register

Someone at the entrance with a notebook and pen. Name, amount, sometimes relationship. It’s how it’s been done for years. It works. The downsides: one book, one handwriting, no backup. If the book is lost or damaged, that list is gone. Still the default in many places, and perfectly valid if you’re okay with that risk.

## 2. Spreadsheet (Google Sheets or Excel)

You or a family member maintains a sheet. When someone gives — at the venue or via UPI — you add a row: name, amount, date, maybe mode (cash/UPI). Pros: you can share the link, multiple people can edit, you have a digital copy. Cons: someone has to remember to update it. If UPI payments come in and nobody logs them, the sheet is incomplete. So it only works if you’re disciplined about entering every contribution as it happens.

## 3. UPI + screenshots and notes

Guests pay to your UPI ID or QR. You get the money; the bank or UPI app tells you the amount, sometimes a name or note, often not. People then try to track by saving screenshots, forwarding to a family group, or scribbling on paper. It’s messy. By the end of the day you’re matching amounts to names from three different sources. Fine for small functions; for a big wedding it gets chaotic fast.

## 4. One link for the event

You create one contribution link (or QR) for the wedding. Guests open the link, pay via UPI as they normally would — no new app — and the contribution (name + amount) is recorded in one place. You get a live list and totals; when you’re done you can export it. The idea is: same giving, same UPI, but the tracking is built in so you’re not chasing screenshots or a single notebook.

**[Moi](https://getmoi.in)** does this: one event, one link or QR, contributions logged as they come in, export when the function is over. If you want to try it, you can [set up an event in under a minute](https://app.getmoi.in/signup). It’s free.

In 2026 most people are comfortable paying by UPI. The gap isn’t payment — it’s record-keeping. The best way to track is the one you’ll actually use: register if you trust the book, spreadsheet if you’ll keep it updated, or one link if you want everything in one place without the scribble-and-screenshot mess.
