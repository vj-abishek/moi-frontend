You get envelopes, UPI transfers, maybe a few gift cards. By the time the wedding is over, you’re left with a pile of “who gave what” that’s half in your head, half on scraps, and half in a family WhatsApp thread. Losing track isn’t careless—it’s what happens when a lot is going on and there’s no single place for it.

Here’s what actually works.

## Use one place and stick to it

Don’t split it: some names in a notebook, some in a spreadsheet, some only in your phone. Pick one place and put everything there. A spreadsheet is enough: columns like *Name*, *Relationship*, *Amount or gift*, *Date received*, *Thank-you sent (Y/N)*. You don’t need anything fancy. The point is that “the list” lives in one file or one notebook, and everyone who’s logging knows where it is.

## Log soon after you receive

The moment you have a name and an amount (or a description of the gift), add it. If you wait until the end of the day or the end of the event, you’ll forget who gave cash in an unmarked envelope or which UPI note was from whom. Write it down or type it in while it’s fresh. Same idea for cards: keep them in one box or folder, and when you open one, log it before you put it away.

## Handle cash and envelopes carefully

Cash is the easiest to lose track of. As soon as someone hands you an envelope, write their name on it (or ask and write it) before you put it anywhere. If you’re not logging immediately, the envelope itself is the record until you do. Don’t mix unmarked cash with marked envelopes.

## Keep a thank-you checklist

“Not losing records” isn’t only about who gave what—it’s also about not forgetting to thank people. Add a simple *Thank-you sent?* column or list. When you send a note or a message, mark it. That way you’re not guessing later whether you thanked everyone.

## Back up the list

If your list is digital, copy it somewhere safe: another drive, email it to yourself, or use something that syncs. If it’s on paper, keep that notebook or folder in one safe place and don’t let pages get torn out or mixed with other stuff. One lost sheet is enough to break the whole system.

## If you want it all in one link

A lot of couples still do the above with a spreadsheet or a notebook, and that’s fine. If you’d rather have one shared link where you (or guests) can log contributions, see totals in real time, and export at the end, tools like Moi are built for that—same idea, just digital and shareable. Whatever you choose, the principles are the same: one place, log soon, and don’t let cash or cards become anonymous.

You don’t need a perfect system. You need a single place, updated regularly, so that when someone asks “did we thank Auntie?” or “how much did so-and-so give?”, you can answer without digging through screenshots and scraps.
