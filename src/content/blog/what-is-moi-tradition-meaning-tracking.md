If you've been to a Tamil wedding or a housewarming, you've seen it: someone at the entrance with a register, writing down names and amounts as guests hand over envelopes or transfer money. That practice — and the record being kept — is **மொய்** (moi).

## What is moi?

**மொய் (moi)** is the custom of giving money or gifts at special occasions — weddings, housewarmings, birthdays, sometimes other functions — and having those contributions written down. The person keeping the book isn't just tallying cash; they're keeping a record of who gave what. That record matters. It's a mix of thanks, support, and the unspoken expectation that when the other person has a function, you'll show up and give too. The list is how people remember.

So in practice: moi is both the act of giving and the system of recording it. The **மொய் பட்டியல்** (moi list/register) is the notebook that has survived decades of functions.

## Why the record matters

Without the list, you don't know who contributed. You can't thank people properly. You can't return the gesture fairly when their turn comes. So the register isn't bureaucracy — it's how the tradition holds up over time. The problem is that the register itself is fragile: one notebook, one pen, bad handwriting, and no backup. Lose it and a lot of that social memory is gone.

## How to track it today

People still use the physical register. It works. But if you want something that doesn't get lost, can be read by everyone in the family, and updates in real time (especially when guests pay by UPI), you need a digital record.

**[Moi](https://getmoi.in)** is built for that: one link or QR per event, guests pay or log cash without installing anything, and you get a live list and totals. When you're done, you can export the list and keep it. Same tradition, same purpose — just a register that doesn't depend on one notebook and one handwriting.

If you're organising a function and you're tired of the scribble-and-hope system, you can [set up your first event in under a minute](https://app.getmoi.in/signup). It's free.
