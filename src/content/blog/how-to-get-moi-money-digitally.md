The day after the function, you open your bank app. Money's come in — good. Then someone asks: "Who all sent? Did so-and-so contribute?" You're scrolling through notifications, digging for a screenshot your cousin sent three days ago, or a bit of paper with half the names in one handwriting and the rest in another. Sound familiar?

Gift money at weddings and celebrations is the norm. Doing it digitally — UPI, no envelopes — is convenient for everyone. The trouble starts when you actually need to know who gave what.

## The normal way

You share your UPI number or put a QR code on a board. Guests open PhonePe, GPay, or whatever they use, and send the money. It lands in your account. Simple.

Except the tracking part. Screenshots in the family group, some with just "Rs 5000" and no name. A scrap of paper that got wet. Someone who said "I'll send tomorrow" — did they? You're not sure. Later, when you want to thank people properly or just answer "how much did we get?", you're piecing it together from three different places. That's how most people do it today. It works until you need to actually know.

## The getmoi way

One link for your event. Guests still pay via UPI exactly as they always do — you're not changing how they pay. The only difference: when someone sends money, you (or they) log the contribution in one place. Name, amount, done. No app for guests to install; the link works in any browser.

You get a live list that everyone with access can see. No lost notes. When your aunt asks "how much have we got so far?" you can show her the screen. When the function is over, export everything as a CSV and keep it for your records — and for the thank-you notes you actually want to send.

## Try it

If you're tired of the screenshot-and-scribble routine, give Moi a try for your next event. It's free, and it takes about 30 seconds to set up.
