      <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
      <p class="lead text-base-content/60">Last updated: January 07, 2026</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This policy outlines the terms for refunds and cancellations for services provided by Moi. We are committed to ensuring a fair and transparent process for all our users.
      </p>

      <h2>Nature of Service</h2>
      <p>
        Moi is a platform for managing and tracking gift contributions (மொய்) for events such as weddings, birthdays, and other celebrations. We provide the following services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Event creation and management tools</li>
        <li>Digital contribution tracking and record-keeping</li>
        <li>QR code generation for easy contribution logging</li>
        <li>Analytics and export features</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Payment Facilitation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Moi does not process or hold any gift money. We only facilitate the recording and tracking of contributions. All actual payments between guests and event hosts occur directly through UPI apps (GPay, PhonePe, Paytm, etc.) or cash.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Moi does not handle the actual gift transactions, we cannot refund any gift amounts. Disputes regarding gift payments must be resolved directly between the parties involved.
      </p>

      <h2>Subscription Cancellation</h2>
      <p>
        If you have subscribed to any premium features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cancel anytime:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings</li>
        <li><strong>Access until period end:</strong> After cancellation, you will continue to have access to premium features until the end of your current billing period</li>
        <li><strong>No partial refunds:</strong> We do not provide refunds for partial subscription periods</li>
        <li><strong>Data retention:</strong> Your data will be retained according to our Privacy Policy</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Refund Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds for subscription payments may be considered in the following cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical issues:</strong> If you experience persistent technical problems that prevent you from using the service, and our support team cannot resolve them</li>
        <li><strong>Billing errors:</strong> If you were charged incorrectly or multiple times for the same service</li>
        <li><strong>Service unavailability:</strong> If the service was unavailable for an extended period during your subscription</li>
      </ul>
